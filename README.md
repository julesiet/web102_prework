## Notes

I had a great time re-discovering my lost love for Javascript from 1-2 years ago, and completing this Prework for WEB102 gave me
a refreshing re-introduction back into the world of Javascript, as well as a solid chunk of techniques and concepts that I had
NEVER even touched on previously. It was great to see the usage of arrow functions, DOM manipulation and this relationship
between Javascript, HTML and JSON files come together so neatly - even if it was difficult to pin down at first. :D
